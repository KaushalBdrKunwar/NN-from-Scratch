# NN-from-Scratch
This project implements a fully connected neural network (MLP) using NumPy, with custom forward and backward propagation, ReLU activation, MSE loss, and gradient descent for training. Built from scratch without TensorFlow or PyTorch, itâ€™s a great learning tool for understanding deep learning fundamentals.
